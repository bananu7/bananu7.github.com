Hi!  
I've decided to try the blogging thing again. This time though, I'll radically lower my expectations and ambitions. I've realized that my perfectionism that pushed me to create the best content has been preventing me from creating any content at all.  
  
To mark this change, I'm moving from git commits to a WYSIWYG editor to lower the barrier of entry even more.  
  
TEST - this shouldn't get published yet.
