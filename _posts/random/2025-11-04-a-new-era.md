Hi!  
I've decided to try the blogging thing again. This time though, I'll radically lower my expectations and ambitions. I've realized that my perfectionism that pushed me to create the best content has been preventing me from creating any content at all.

To mark this change, I'm moving from git commits to a WYSIWYG editor to lower the barrier of entry even more - I've dediced to try Pages CMS; for now in the online-hosted version. Normally, I'd go to self-host it immediately, but since we're doing it to remove friction, let's use this for now.  
  
(Hopefully) Talk to you soon.
